      <h1 style="color: red;">Lex Luthor</h1>
      <p>"As we say, Lex Luthor isn't just Superman's greatest enemy,
           he's one of the greatest supervillains of the entire DCU and heck,
            all of comic books."
    </p>
    <p>
        Still, with Luthor, it all comes back to Superman. Throughout all his incarnations
         -  corrupt businessman ... mad scientist ... all-out, megalomaniacal, world-conquering
          supervillain ... to his current-day role of Earth-protector - his motivation is almost always
          the same: take down the Man of Steel, prove that Luthor is the best and that all others are beneath
           him.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whatever the incarnation of Lex Luthor, there's a perfect dichotomy between Luthor and Superman.
         Superman represents an outside force, achieving things that humanity could never dream to accomplish,
          all for the good of his adopted world. Luthor is humanity's greatest potential, too selfish and
           arrogant to use his gifts to better anyone but himself. There's a subtle, but brilliant dynamic
            between the two viewpoints that makes Superman seem all the stronger, and Luthor seem all the more
             malevolent.
    </p>
    <p>
        No Superman villain is as well known, as well-loved, or as well-traveled as Lex Luthor.
         Often seen as the de facto leader of all of the DCU's supervillains, he's been portrayed as
          such in too many incarnations to name, much like Superman is most often seen as the leader of DC's
           pantheon of heroes.
